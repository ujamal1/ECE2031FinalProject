; This code uses the switches to control the color
; of the NeoPixel.
; SW1-0 controls blue,
; SW3-2 controls green,
; SW5-4 controls red.
; The brightness is kept low by only controlling
; low bits in the values:
; ---RR---GG----BB
; Even though green accepts six bits, this doesn't use
; the lowest bit so that green is the same magnitude
; as red and blue.
